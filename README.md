# Jalopnik Scraper

## The Project:
A fullstack news scraper built to scrape the 40 most-recent news stories from Jalopnik.com. Users can add comments to the articles of their choice or choose to view the entire article on Jalopnik.com.

## Instructions:
As soon as you land on <a href="https://morning-harbor-46432.herokuapp.com/">Jalopnik Scraper</a>, you'll be presented with a simple message instructing you to scrape the news. 

Click that scrape button (there's a scrape button available in the top-right of the nav as well) to display articles from Jalopnik.com

Once articles are displayed, click on an article to open the comments diaglogue. Here, you can add a title and a comment and save it for that specific article.

Enjoy!
